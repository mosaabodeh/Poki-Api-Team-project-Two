# Poki-Api-Team-project-Two
using poki api in node js project and ejs ==> selecting 3 pokimon (name , image , Weight, Length)

 Dear Engineer Samer, I hope you are in the best condition....
I am sorry for not completing the task professionally. I did not do that because I did not find enough time to do the task and I wanted to hand it in so that your initial impression of me would not be bad (I contacted you on the Slack application and told you about my difficult circumstances (the events of the last dialogue and the assault on it). I will complete the task within the next two days I want to walk with the team in the procesing and management of the project))
thanks for understanding
thanks for your time (:
